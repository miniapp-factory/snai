A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added in order to implement the quiz, display the results, generate the animal images, and update the app logo and metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to place the quiz on the home page and render the result component.  
2. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that contains the quiz logic and UI.  
3. `mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx` – new component that shows the animal result and share button.  
4. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.  
5. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.  
6. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – to generate the cat image.  
7. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – to generate the dog image.  
8. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – to generate the fox image.  
9. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – to generate the hamster image.  
10. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – to generate the horse image.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

I need to add a few new files and modify the two files you’ve already provided.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can give you the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
